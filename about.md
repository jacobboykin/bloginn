**Hey!** I'm Jacob - a system administrator, web developer and musician based in Melbourne, Florida. Welcome to my tech blog! I use this space to talk about techy things that I think are cool, or wisdom that I've learned that I want to share.

When I'm not learning about the latest tech, I'm making music, playing with my dog or playing video games.

*Thank You for reading!*
